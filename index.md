This is the main page for docmentation related to Voxel, welcome!

### Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The voxel libraries (found at [Voxelated](https://github.com/Voxelated) are a
collection of libraries which provide general C++, compute, and graphics
related functionality. The implementations are intended to execute efficiently,
however, the reason for these libraries is to learn, and thus there are likely
more efficient implementations available. Where functionality is implemented
which is known to be provided by another library, the implementations are
benchmarked to accurately compare the performance.

### Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing to do is to get a development environment setup. See the
[Getting Started](GettingStarted.html) page, or select the link at the top of
the page.

### Guides
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next thing to do would be to read through the guides. This is very
important for getting code successfully committed into the code base. See the
[Guides](Guides.html) page, or select the link at the top of the page.

### Libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are numerous libraries, some of which will be relevant, and other which
will not be. Nevertheless, they are all well documented and the documentation
can be found at [Libraries](Libraries.html), or by selecting the link at the
top of the page.
