## Overview 

Pixel's software follows a library based design, where (hopefully) the
libraries are as orthogonal to each other as possible. This is often
difficult, but every attempt is made to achieve this. When designing software,
first look for the functionality in another Pixel library before designing a
new implementation.

## Getting Started

There is some documentation to be read before getting started:

* Engine Overview: This page gives an overview of the engine design. It's gives
  a torough introduction to the engine and will provide a base for
  understanding the codebase.
* [Pixel Coding Conventions](CodingConventions) : The 
  conventions used for all Pixel code. These are important, as code which does
  not conform to the coding conventions won't be accepted.
