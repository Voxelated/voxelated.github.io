This is the main page for docmentation related to Voxel, welcome!

### Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The voxel libraries (found at [Voxelated](https://github.com/Voxelated) are a
collection of libraries which provide general C++, compute, and graphics
related functionality. The implementations are intended to execute efficiently,
however, the reason for these libraries is to learn, and thus there are likely
more efficient implementations available. Where functionality is implemented
which is known to be provided by another library, the implementations are
benchmarked to accurately compare the performance.

### Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Getting Started](GettingStarted.html) page provides an introduction to the Voxel libraries.

### Guides
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Guides](Guides.html) page gives a list of useful articles which describe
how to do something, or use a specific piece of software, etc.

### Libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are numerous libraries, some of which will be relevant, and other which
will not be. Nevertheless, they are all well documented and the documentation
can be found at [Libraries](Libraries.html), or by selecting the link at the
top of the page.
