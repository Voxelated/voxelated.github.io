This page provides a reference point (other than Pixel's repository) for all
the internal libraries. This page consists of a few parts:

  1. It defines the structure of an internal software library. This is
     important so that **all** libraries have the same structure, which makes
     navigating them simple.

  2. It defines how to correctly document a library, so that anyone not working
     on the library can easily navigate it and understand it.

  3. It defines a list of all the libraries, with a brief overview of what each
     one does.
